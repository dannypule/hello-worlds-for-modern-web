A bunch of 'hello worlds' for a bunch of stuff. Yeah, nice and descriptive, I know :)

This repo is used for documenting 'hello worlds' for things like Typescript, Webpack, @ngrx and other web technologies. 
It's a good way to try out different things while being able to return to this repo in the future if I need clarification on a topic.
